- Installing mongoose using "npm i mongoose" works normally (although with some warnings, it works)
- Prefer using "npm i mongoose@8.0.0" (although with some warnings, it also works)
- Knowing that Nodejs goes from top to bottom in order, if you have /:id and /demo (in this order) it won't run /demo, it'll run 
/:id every single time because you have changed the value of the params of /:id (which is :id) to the value "demo", 
so everytime it will run to /:id but with "demo" as the value. But if you change the order to /demo and then /:id then it will run 
both /demo and /:id separately. For example, "localhost:8080/api/v1/urls/url/demo" this will not run to /demo, it will run to
/:id but with params value being "demo". Be carefule with anything params. If i have /:id, when I call /demo, /:id will be called
but if i call /demo/demo then /demo/demo will be called not /:id

by hand. Stated in https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-nodejs/connect/
